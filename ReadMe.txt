## 3DOF robotic arm is driven from the user-defined inputs from MATLAB GUI
## .ino program is uploaded into ARDUINO microprocessor
## the microprocessor reads the angle information through the serial port 
## MATLAB GUI sends the angle information to the microprocessor through the serial port
## the desired angles are tracked using PID controller
